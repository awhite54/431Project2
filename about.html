            <p>Hello, my name is Austin White. I was born on August 26th, 1997, and have lived my entire life in the Northern Virginia area. The fourth of five children, I took an interest in computers from my father, who moved to northern Virginia 30 years ago to work at the Washington Post. Originally a sports editor, my dad then moved to working on the Post's website before leaving the Post to become a Project Manager for multiple different companies. I received my GED in 2019, and attending Northern Virginia Community college, where I received an Associate of Science Degree. I am now attending George Mason University, where I am working on receiving a Bachelor of Science degree in IT, with a focus on web development and multimedia. I am expected to graduate by the end of 2024. I greatly enjoy creating interactive websites, apps, and even video games. I hope to begin employment as a junior web designer following my graduation. In my spare time I enjoy riding my bike and playing video games. Video games have long been my passion, so much so Iâ€™ve taken some online game design classes not associated with GMU and experiment with Blender, an open-source 3D computer graphics software tool. I am an excellent public speaker and have been told numerous times I have the qualities of a great leader. I am a lector at my local church and volunteer bi-weekly at their food pantry. I also work part-time as a server at a local restaurant called The Black Sheep and have been employed there for the last year and a half. Thank you for reading about me and have a nice day!</p>
